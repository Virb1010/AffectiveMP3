Welcome to Affective MP3!

This program is a limited MP3 player which allows you to provide facial data
as input. Simply press calibrate, and use your facial expressions to tell the
program what type of music you want to listen to. The program currently 
supports 5 moods. These are:

Happy - Smile
Sad - Open Mouth
Angry - Nose Wrinkle
Romantic - Lip Pucker
Instrumental - Lip Stretch/Conceal

Once the program has collected enough facial data, it will automatically play
music from the mood it detected from your expression. You can choose to listen
to the song, play another song of the same mood, or recalibrate to change your
mood input.

In some cases, the Affectiva detector misattributes the mood the user is aiming
to convey, in which case you may click the 'Wrong Vibe' button. The program will 
then estimate the mood you were aiming to convey with your initial input. If the
vibe is still wrong, thte program will prompt you to recalibrate once again.

Enjoy!
